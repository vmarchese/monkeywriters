/* Monkey Schema 
  The fields 
     followers
     followings
     likedstories
  can have a very large amount of values. 
  One solution is to use the Field selection feature in MongoDB
  A more efficient solution would be using not embedded arrays (i.e. separate queries)
  also to avoid the 16MB limit of MongoDB.
  If the "embedded" solution will be adopted, the pagination on those fields
  can be done with the $slice feature.

  An even more efficient solution would be populating (and updating) those arrays with the latest
  number (i.e.20) of entries (also using separate documents) to immediately get the lates info
  without doing other queries. The queries on the associated tables will be done only in case
  of further browsing of those structures.
  e.g. The monkey asks for his followers page and the system already has the latest 20 in the 
       Monkey document (in array "followers"). If the users browses the following pages in the
       pagination, other queries are performed to get the next items.
